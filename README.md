- Hi, I’m @Mvinueza1
- I’m interested in how ecosystem dynamics mold the evolutionary paths of species at different scales
- I’m currently learning how to use R to use data science to answer questions in biology, specifically in genetic and genomic speaciation studies
- I’m looking to collaborate on anything that would help me improve my grasp on R and in Google Earth Engine
- I´m interested in GLMs, GAMs, GLMMs and other frquentist non paratric test statistics
- I´d like to learn how bayesian tree inference and Marcov Chain Montercarlo algorithms work
